//
//  VoicePlaybackEngine.swift
//  Wanna
//
//  The shared audio engine for BOTH halves of the voice conversation: TTS
//  playback (AVAudioPlayerNode) and continuous-listening capture (the input
//  tap).
//
//  WHY THE TTS AND THE MICROPHONE SHARE ONE ENGINE — the AEC, and it is the
//  reason this class exists at all. Voice processing cancels "any of the audio
//  that is played from the device at a given time from the incoming audio"
//  (AVAudioIONode.h, setVoiceProcessingEnabled:error:), and it can only do that
//  for audio rendered through the SAME engine. Playing the answer through one
//  engine while listening on another leaves the answer in the microphone — for
//  the recognizer to transcribe as if the user had said it.
//
//  VOICE PROCESSING WAS REMOVED EARLIER ON 2026-09-23 AND IS BACK THE SAME DAY,
//  this time with the ducking turned down. The removal was never about the AEC
//  being wrong: enabling VPIO marks the app as a "communication" app and macOS
//  then DUCKS every other application's audio for as long as the engine runs
//  (the FaceTime behaviour; third-party utilities like Unduck-Pro exist purely
//  to fight it), and with 持续监听 holding the engine up for whole listening
//  windows every other app on the machine was attenuated to a whisper — the
//  user's 「任何一个软件的音量都被降到了非常低的程度」.
//
//  What the removal cost, measured 2026-09-23 and reported by the user the same
//  day: with no AEC the answer reaches the microphone raw while it plays (the
//  recording mute has to lift so the user can hear it), and the recognizer
//  transcribes OUR OWN ANSWER as perfectly real words. That one fact produced
//  BOTH reported failures, in opposite directions:
//
//    * heard correctly, our words matched the text-level echo filter
//      (BuddyDictationManager.continuousListeningTranscriptIsEchoOfSpokenAnswer)
//      and were correctly refused as a barge-in — so the answer kept playing
//      over the user's real speech, and interrupting seemed to need three or
//      four sentences;
//    * mis-heard by a single character, the same words failed that filter's
//      containment test, were taken for the user's, and the answer interrupted
//      itself — the self-interruption the user reported twice.
//
//  No text filter can win that: on a mixed signal the transcript is unreliable
//  in both directions. The fix is to un-mix the signal, and the ducking that
//  forced the removal is CONFIGURABLE on macOS 14 — which is what makes it
//  possible to have the AEC back without the volume complaint:
//
//      inputNode.voiceProcessingOtherAudioDuckingConfiguration =
//          AVAudioVoiceProcessingOtherAudioDuckingConfiguration(
//              enableAdvancedDucking: false,   // never duck harder on voice activity
//              duckingLevel: .min)             // the mildest base ducking offered
//
//  Apple's own sample for this is `setVoiceProcessingEnabled(true)` followed by
//  a ducking configuration (WWDC23 session 10235, "What's new in voice
//  processing"), and the header documents the default as "disable advanced
//  ducking, with a ducking level set to
//  AVAudioVoiceProcessingOtherAudioDuckingLevelDefault" — the level that caused
//  the complaint was therefore the DEFAULT level, and `.min` is strictly below
//  it. 「回声消除」 (AppSettings.echoCancellationEnabled, default on) is the
//  user's way back out if their music dips.
//
//  TWO ORDERING RULES COME WITH IT, and both are measured rather than assumed.
//  Voice processing can only be toggled while the engine is stopped
//  (AVAudioIONode.h), so it is applied at every engine start — which is also
//  what makes a settings change land on the next reply instead of mid-answer,
//  since the engine is released whenever it goes idle. And the main mixer node
//  has to be touched BEFORE voice processing is enabled, or the engine will not
//  start at all: see `warmUpMainMixerNode` for the four-variant measurement and
//  for the -10875 that used to cost every reply its first spoken segment.
//
//  Voice processing is applied only when it is actually wanted
//  (`isEchoCancellationWantedProvider`): with 持续监听 off this engine never
//  carries a microphone tap, so there is nothing for an AEC to do and no reason
//  to pay its price. The engine is started on demand (first playback or first
//  listening tap) and stopped again when both go idle, so neither the
//  microphone route nor the ducking is held open permanently between replies.
//
//  THE DUCKING IS SCOPED TO PLAYBACK BY RUNNING TWO ENGINES, and that is the
//  other half of the same complaint. Applying the AEC only when it is *wanted*
//  was not enough: the listening window keeps an engine running for up to 30 s
//  after an answer with nothing playing, so the voice-processing IO ducked every
//  other application for that whole window — reported as 「按键之前和之后都压低了
//  电脑的系统音量… 正常情况下，用户没有使用这个软件… 的时候，不应该也压低音量」.
//
//  THE OBVIOUS FIX IS THE ONE THAT DOES NOT WORK, and the measurement is worth
//  keeping: turning voice processing OFF on the live engine while keeping the
//  tap. Measured 2026-09-23 with a probe that instruments FRAMES rather than
//  callbacks — the decisive number, because a tap whose callbacks fire with no
//  frames in them starves the recognizer just the same. With voice processing on,
//  the tap delivers 48000 frames/s (real time). After
//  `setVoiceProcessingEnabled(false)` plus a restart it delivers **0 callbacks
//  and 0 frames**, under every reinstall format tried (the old format,
//  `outputFormat(forBus: 0)`, `nil`, and `inputFormat(forBus: 0)`). Adding
//  `reset()` does not recover it either: it leaves `inputFormat(forBus: 0)` at
//  `48000 Hz / 0 ch` and the next `start()` fails -10875 with
//  `IsFormatSampleRateAndChannelCountValid`. A *fresh* engine, by contrast, pulls
//  a tap at 48000 frames/s with no voice processing and no downstream connection
//  at all. The toggle reconfigures the whole IO and this engine does not come
//  back from it — which is precisely the situation `AVAudioEngine.h:561`
//  documents a way out of: "For applications which may need to dynamically switch
//  between output-only and input-output modes, it may be advantageous to use two
//  engine instances."
//
//  So there are two engines, and the microphone MOVES between them. `engine` is
//  the playback engine: player node, time-pitch node, voice processing, and the
//  tap whenever there is audio to cancel. `captureOnlyEngine` has NO voice
//  processing and holds the tap whenever nothing is playing — the state that used
//  to duck the rest of the machine. Exactly one of them runs at a time, and the
//  tap lives on the one that runs: that is what keeps the AEC working (it only
//  cancels audio rendered through the same engine) while nothing is ducked for.
//  The hand-off happens at `releaseEngineWhenIdle` (playback ended, the window is
//  still listening) and at `ensureEngineStarted` (the next chunk), and the tap's
//  handler and buffer size are kept so it can be moved without the capture side
//  knowing — see `installInputTap`.
