    // one (AEC 承重 + VAD 阈值/时长防误触发), and since 2026-09-23 the

    // ① the system AEC (Apple voice processing, on the shared playback engine
    //    — see VoicePlaybackEngine's header) removes the app's own answer from
    //    the microphone BEFORE the recognizer sees it. This is the layer that
    //    matters: without it the answer arrives as perfectly real words and no
    //    later layer can tell them apart from the user's.
    // ② the recording mute (SystemSpeakerMuteCoordinator) keeps system audio
    //    out of the mic while nothing is playing — it is what covers the
    //    windows in which ① is not running, and it is why AEC is only needed
    //    while an answer is actually being read aloud.
    // ③ a smoothed-RMS threshold rejects background hiss,
    // ④ a sustained-speech debounce rejects clicks and door slams,
    // ⑤ a minimum transcript length keeps a short artefact from being sent
    //    as a question even if ①-④ all let something through.
    //
    // The threshold is on the waveform's boosted scale (RMS × 10.2), and it
    // was calibrated 2026-09-23 against this machine's built-in mic with a
    // 15 s quiet-room probe: the ambient floor peaked at 0.167 (typical
    // 0.09–0.11), so the original 0.06 sat BELOW the noise floor and the VAD
    // fired constantly in silence — every answer triggered a garbage follow-up
    // (「嗯。」) and the whole runaway-loop failure. Normal speech measures

    //
    // Why (measured 2026-09-23, probe: a real Chinese voice played through the
    // system speakers into this same tap topology, while VPIO was still in
    // place): the smoothed level
    // during continuous speech reads peak 0.772 / p95 0.556 but p50 0.159 —
    // natural articulation dips below 0.25 roughly half the time, and the
    // smoothing decays at 0.72 per tap buffer, so the level is already down
    // between syllables. The previous rule asked for 0.35 s of CONTINUOUS
    // above-threshold time, which normal speech never delivers, so
    // `continuousListeningUtteranceActive` never became true: nothing to send
    // after 2–3 s of silence (「等待了两秒、三秒，它还是没有发送」) and a
    // shortcut press found nothing pending, fell through to the stop branch
    // and exited listening (「我按住快捷键的话，它还是自动退出」).
    //
    // A leaky accumulator tolerates those dips the way pipecat's neural VAD
    // tolerates them, while still demanding real speech rather than one loud
    // click. Rising costs the full poll interval, falling returns only a
    // quarter of it, so ~0.2 s of net speech confirms the utterance and a
    // brief pause cannot undo it.

    // While the answer plays, the microphone LEVEL is evidence of nothing — and
    // that is a measurement, not a margin (2026-09-24).
    //
    // An earlier attempt settled only a reply's first moments with an onset
    // grace (0.8 s), on the theory that our own voice leaking back into the
    // microphone was an AEC convergence TRANSIENT: the canceller has no
    // far-end signal between replies, so it re-converges against a new
    // reference and the leak passes. The app's own log says otherwise.
    // Measured across four replies while an answer was playing and the user was
    // NOT speaking, the microphone peak read 0.876 / 1.000 / 1.000 / 1.000 —
    // against a room floor of 0.167 and a CONVERGED echo of 0.111. A peak at
    // full scale is not a transient to wait out; it is our own answer arriving
    // louder at the microphone than the room it plays into, and once it clips,
    // a linear canceller cannot remove it. It clears the 0.25 speech threshold
    // for the WHOLE reply, not its first second.
    //
    // What that produced is the user's 「偶尔发声，偶尔不读」/「十次九次都没有声音」
    // (2026-09-24): the level path was licensed to interrupt an answer whenever
    // the echo-cancellation flag was set, so the reply killed ITSELF on its own
    // voice — and the recognizer's mis-hearing of that clipped signal (「嗯。」
    // 「我」「中间」, one to three content characters) also cleared the
    // level-corroborated 1-character bar, so the transcript path killed it too.
    // One character of the app's own audio is not a barge-in.
    //
    // The rule is therefore the stricter one for exactly this case — the echo
    // reaching the recognizer: "If the bot is speaking we want to interrupt
    // using min words" (pipecat's `MinWordsUserTurnStartStrategy`), i.e. MORE
    // evidence while the bot speaks, never less. The bar-free pair
    // (`VADUserTurnStartStrategy` + `TranscriptionUserTurnStartStrategy`) is
    // only safe where the canceller stays converged for the whole session;
    // this app restarts its canceller per reply, which is what makes the local
    // rule the stricter one.
    //
    // Concretely, the level VAD is the ONLY thing that may start a turn, while
    // the answer plays or not. The reason is structural rather than a
    // threshold: where the STT is segmented by the VAD, a transcript cannot
    // exist until the VAD has already ruled that the user spoke, so a
    // transcript is never an independent trigger there. Here the recognizer
    // free-runs, and one guessed character is all it takes — so the source is
    // restricted instead. Real barge-in is unaffected: the user's own speech
    // measures 0.3–1.0 against a 0.25 threshold.
