//
//  The assistant reply's card, in one of three themes (blue / black / paper)
//  chosen in 设置 → 交互样式. Ported from the user's reference spec
//  (「clip 卡片样式」, 实现说明.md): a 10pt-corner card with a 1.5pt border,
//  tight 10/12 padding, 13.5pt text on a ~22pt line pitch — and the spec's
//  signature text animation, the blur-focus stream: every new character
//  enters blurred (blur 2.6) and half-transparent (opacity 0.2), and settles
//  to fully sharp with a 0.3s ease once five more units have arrived behind
//  it, leaving a ~5-unit blurred tail at the writing edge.
//
//  SwiftUI cannot blur individual characters inside one Text, so the text is
//  split into units (one unit per CJK character, contiguous Latin/digit runs
//  kept whole so English words never wrap mid-word). Newlines become break
//  markers: 「\n\n」 opens a 14pt paragraph gap, a bare 「\n」 just ends the line.
//
//  ONE line-breaking rule renders both states. `CardTextLineBreaker` packs the
//  units into lines, and both the streaming card and the settled card are drawn
//  from those same lines — the settled card as one Text per paragraph, the
//  streaming card as those same paragraphs plus its still-growing last line
//  rendered per unit (that is where the blur-focus tail lives). The card used to
//  break its lines twice — a greedy flow Layout while streaming, one whole-string
//  Text once settled — and the two engines disagreed: measured on a real
//  1482-character reply, 55 lines streaming against 62 settled, so the card grew
//  seven lines (~150 pt) the instant a reply finished. Per-unit views also cost
//  far more than they look: one Text per unit through SwiftUI's layout on every
//  streamed character measured at 88% of the main thread and ~117% of one CPU
//  core, against 12% idle.
//
//  系统开启「减弱动态效果」时全部直接清晰显示，不做任何动画
//  (参考规范's prefers-reduced-motion degradation).
