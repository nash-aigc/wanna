//  Bailian has no OpenAI-compatible TTS route, so this talks to DashScope's

//  than a stream: it answers with a URL to a finished WAV file, which is then
//  downloaded and played. There is no partial audio to start playing early.
//
//  Which endpoint is correct depends on the model family, and Alibaba documents
//  the two as non-interchangeable: Qwen-Audio-TTS / CosyVoice live on
//  `/api/v1/services/audio/tts/SpeechSynthesizer`, while Qwen-TTS
//  (`qwen3-tts-flash`) lives on `/api/v1/services/aigc/multimodal-generation/
//  generation`. Posting to the wrong one fails with `InvalidParameter: url
//  error`, so the model, the voice, the body fields and the path all move
